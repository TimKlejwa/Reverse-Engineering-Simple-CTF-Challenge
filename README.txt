This is a Reverse Engineering Challenge.

The exploiter is looking to print out the flag in the program. To do this they will need to analyze the binary with a program such and ghidra. They will then find out that the code needs to be XOR'd with 0x5 in order to obtain the solution.

To run the bin simply open the command prompt on windows and type "reverse200.bin"

The correct password is: CTF34D3X
